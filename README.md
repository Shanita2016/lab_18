Steve, Shanita, and Benson

## General HTML
+ make use of ng-repeat


## Multiple Routes

+ create route.js
+ use ngRoute (include it in our module) to connect views
+ add navigation for views in index.html
in app.js
var app = angular.module('ourAppName', ['ngRoute'])


in route.js
refer to our existing module
include $RouteProvider
set up the when / otherwise statements

## Controllers
+ create 2 controllers

## Views
+ set up two or more separate views (when statements)
+ each view should have it's own controller

## Services

+ create 1 service pulling data (twitter feed?)

## Directives
